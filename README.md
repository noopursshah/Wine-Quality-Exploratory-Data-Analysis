Wine quality depends on a multitude of factors, including quantifiable variables like its chemical properties. In this project, we aim to predict a numerical value indicating the quality of a specific wine using its chemical properties. In particular, we consider the red wine variant of the Portuguese vinho verde, using data provided by the Wine Quality Data Set (Cortez et al., 2009). The dataset consists of eleven predictor variables and one response variable, quality, which was based on the median of at least three experts' ratings between 0 and 10–referring to very bad and excellent, respectively. We aim to answer the central question: “Can the quality of red vinho verde wine be predicted using its chemical properties?”
